            <h2>7 Ways to Make Home Feel Cozier</h2>

               <h3>A Warming Entryway</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>The entryway is the first part of the home that you, your family and guests will see, and it should invite you to leave the cold, wet weather behind you.</li>
                <li>Create an entryway that feels both functional and welcoming, with room for guests to leave umbrellas, coats, hats and scarves.</li>
                <li>If possible, add a bench or chair, so weary visitors can easily remove damp boots. For more tips, read our guide to creating a joy-sparking entryway.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>House Shoes</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>In homes throughout Japan, you’ll find house slippers waiting for everyone at the front door, along with a rack for guests to leave their shoes.</li>
                <li>If you don’t regularly practice a “no shoes” policy in your home, consider trying one this winter. It will prevent anyone from tracking snow, rain and mud into the house, but more importantly, slippers (like these or these) keep toes warm and make the coldest days feel cozier.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Seasonal Scents</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>The power of scent is undeniable, and it can instantly change the feeling of any room.</li>
                <li>We like to switch up our usual scents in the winter, trading spring and summer florals for warming scents like Japanese cypress or rosewood.</li> 
                <li>Try lighting a candle during your morning routine or before guests arrive will add ambient warmth to the home</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Throw Blankets</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>Some of us chill more easily than others.</li>
                <li>During the fall and winter, place extra blankets in the living room or other shared areas, so everyone can warm up as much as they like </li> 
                <li>To keep blankets tidy, add a storage basket to a corner where you can fold and return them when they’re not in use.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Warm Lighting</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>The days are shorter, so make sure there’s plenty of lighting in each room.</li>
                <li>To make the home feel cozier, avoid overhead lights in favor of lamps and pendant lights and use warm light bulbs.</li>
                <li>When entertaining, add plenty of candlelight with pillars at the table or votives strategically placed around the room.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Cozy Up Your Guest</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>If you’re hosting guests this winter, don’t forget to add some additional blankets to your guest room.</li>
                <li>If room allows, you might also consider adding an electric tea kettle and a selection of herbal or green tea.</li>
                <li>Nothing feels more welcoming on a cold night than a warm cup of tea before bed. For more ideas, read our expert guide to a joy-sparking guest room.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Bathroom Accents</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>When thinking about seasonal changes, it’s easy to overlook the bathroom, but it’s one of the most trafficked rooms in the house!</li>
                <li>There are several simple ways to make it feel cozier.</li> 
                <li>Add a candle to the countertop to light when hosting guests. Consider substituting your usual bath towels with warmer plush versions for the winter.</li> 
                <li>Winter also tends to chap hands and cause sniffles, so keep a rich hand lotion and tissue box in sight!</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Organization is Self Care</h2>
                <dl>
                <dt>"Tidying may have brought you here, but organization just might change your life"</dt>
                <dd>The words “tidying” and “organizing” often summon images of a well-kept home with a spotless kitchen and neatly curated bookshelves. But committing to getting more organized isn’t just about tidying physical spaces — it can bring you a sense of wellbeing in every aspect of your life. Organization not only supports self-care, it is self-care. </dd>

                <dt>"Organization is a form of untapped power"</dt>
                <dd>We all know that chaotic feeling when our lives have become too disorganized, whether because of a messy home, too much travel or one too many work meetings. Disorganization brings on feelings of irritation, anxiety and even panic. It hangs like a cloud over us, affecting everything from our mood to our ability to focus. </dd>

                <dt>"Getting organized means supporting your future self - this is self-care"</dt>
                <dd>From a streamlined work life to a tidy home, research shows that getting organized can fundamentally improve people’s lives. Have you ever noticed that you actually feel better in a well-organized space? A 2016 study from the University of New Mexico found that people in cluttered homes found it more difficult to feel pleasure. Another study from 2009 found that cortisol levels rise when rooms feel cluttered and that organized homes reduce feelings of depression.</dd>

                <dt>"True organization doesn't mean doing it all perfectly"</dt>
                <dd>We can’t plan for everything that happens in our lives, but we can commit to the process of getting more organized. Much like the Japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi, or the acceptance of transcience and imperfection, approaching your life with an organization mindset simply means taking a more mindful approach to how you spend each day. It means letting go of what weighs you down and distracts you from what you value most. Organization is the foundation for a joy-sparking life.</dd>
